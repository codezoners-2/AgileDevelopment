# Exercise: FixMe

The file `fixme-1.py` contains a list of functions with tests. The tests are correct but the functions are buggy. Can you fix them? (Most of the functions are from exercises you've already done.)

## Bonus

The file `fixme-tricky.py` is a single, harder example. The tests are complete, but there's no code yet. Can you implement the function so that all the tests pass?
